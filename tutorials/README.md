# Tutorials

Welcome in the tutorials section.

The idea of this section is to guide you step by step with examples to became a PowerMake master.

We recommend that you follow this tutorial in order.  
You should at least start by the first one, the other are more independents.

This section is not meant to show every argument of every function, the idea is more to show what is possible to do. If you are searching for a very specific thing, you will more likely found it in the [documentation](../documentation.md) or by asking a question in the [discussions section](https://github.com/mactul/powermake/discussions).
