# Crossplatform Library

### [<- Previous tutorial (First PowerMake)](../01-first-powermake/README.md)

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This tutorial assumes that you have followed the first one: [First Powermake](../01-first-powermake/README.md)

In this tutorial, we are going to create 2 minuscule projects, a mini-library and a mini program depending on this library.

## Architecture

```
- tutorial2
  - library
    - include
      - my_time.h
    - src
      - time_linux.c
      - time_windows.c
    - makefile.py
  - program
    - src
      - main.c
    - makefile.py
```

Here is the content of each file:

my_time.h
```c
#ifndef MY_TIME_H
#define MY_TIME_H

void my_sleep(unsigned int ms);

#endif
```

time_linux.c
```c
#include <unistd.h>
#include "my_time.h"


void my_sleep(unsigned int ms)
{
    usleep(1000 * ms);
}
```

time_windows.h
```c
#include <windows.h>
#include "my_time.h"

void my_sleep(unsigned int ms)
{
    Sleep(ms);
}
```

main.c
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include "my_time.h"

int main()
{
    puts("entering 2 seconds sleep");
    my_sleep(2000);
    puts("Waking up from 2 seconds sleep");

    return 0;
}
```

For the makefile.py files, you can start by generating them with the `powermake` command like in the previous tutorial.


## Library makefile

For this library we have 2 new challenges.
- It's a library, we will not be able to use the normal link operation.
- We will have to compile different files depending on the platform.

Let's first address the second issue.

Later, we would do `files = powermake.get_files("**/*.c")`, but here, we must have a condition.  
Something like this:
```py
if config.target_is_windows():
    files = powermake.get_files("src/*windows.c")
else:
    files = powermake.get_files("src/*linux.c")
```

This would work, because we don't have common files between windows and Linux.
But what if we had 100 common files and just some `*windows.c` and some `*linux.c` to separate ?

The best approach is to get all files, then remove the files that we don't want.
```py
files = powermake.get_files("**/*.c")
if config.target_is_windows():
    files = powermake.filter_files(files, "**/*linux.c")
else:
    files = powermake.filter_files(files, "**/*windows.c")
```

And voilÃ  ! Our makefile will now automatically pick the good files to compile, as long as we keep the naming convention !

> [!NOTE]  
> You may be wondering if it's possible to test `config.target_is_linux()`, of course it's possible, but here we should not because usleep will also work under MacOS, FreeBSD, Android, etc... Maybe we should have called our file `time_unix.c`, but whatever...


It's now time to address the link issue !  
The link operation will change if we want a shared library or a static library.  
For the moment, let assume we want a static library.

We just have to replace:
```py
powermake.link_files(config, objects)
```
By:
```py
powermake.archive_files(config, objects)
```

So our final makefile for the library looks like this:
```py
import powermake

def on_build(config: powermake.Config):
    config.add_flags("-Wall", "-Wextra")

    config.add_includedirs("./include/")

    files = powermake.get_files("**/*.c")
    if config.target_is_windows():
        files = powermake.filter_files(files, "**/*linux.c")
    else:
        files = powermake.filter_files(files, "**/*windows.c")

    objects = powermake.compile_files(config, files)

    powermake.archive_files(config, objects)

powermake.run("my_time", build_callback=on_build)
```

You can see that we added `config.add_includedirs("./include/")`, that is required for `time_linux.c` and `time_windows.c` to found the `my_time.h` file.

In the last chapter we haven't talked about the first parameter of `powermake.run`, here it's `"my_time"`.  
This parameter is the name of the project and it is used for link operations to automatically give a name to the binary.  
For example here, we haven't specified the output name for `powermake.archive_files` (yes it's possible to do so, we will see later), so the name will be automatically attributed and will be `libmy_time.a`

Try to run:
```sh
python makefile.py -rv
```
In the `library` subfolder and see that a file named `libmy_time.a` is generated under `build/Linux/x64/release/lib/libmy_time.a`


## Program makefile

This program is close to the one made in the previous chapter, with two differences:
- We will need a way to automatically trigger the library makefile so we will not have to run it by hand each time
- We will need to link with a set of objects AND a static library

Triggering the other makefile is relatively easy thanks to `powermake.run_another_powermake`

```py
libraries = powermake.run_another_powermake(config, "../library/makefile.py")
```
libraries will be a list of the generated libs by `"../library/makefile.py"` (here just `libmy_time.a`)


And linking with objects AND static libraries is also easy using the `archives` parameter of `powermake.link_files`

In the end we have something like this:
```py
import powermake

def on_build(config: powermake.Config):
    config.add_flags("-Wall", "-Wextra")

    config.add_includedirs("../library/include/")

    files = powermake.get_files("**/*.c")

    objects = powermake.compile_files(config, files)

    archives = powermake.run_another_powermake(config, "../library/makefile.py")

    powermake.link_files(config, objects, archives=archives)

powermake.run("program", build_callback=on_build)
```

Run `python makefile.py -rvt` in the `program` subfolder.
You can see that `../library/makefile.py` is indeed called and the final program should work as expected.
